#1. Number Guessing Game 🎯

A console-based number guessing game written in **C++**, developed as part of the CODSOFT internship.

## 🔹 Features
- Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Random number generation
- User input validation
- Attempts tracking
- Replay option
- Clean modular structure using functions

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Compile:
   ```bash
   g++ number_guessing_game.cpp -o game


#2. 🔢 C++ Calculator Program

A simple command-line calculator written in C++ that allows users to perform **continuous arithmetic operations**. After each calculation, the result is used as the starting point for the next operation, enabling chained calculations until the user chooses to exit.

## ✅ Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Continuous operations on the result
- Input validation (e.g., prevents division by zero)
- Clean and readable code with modular functions
- Command-line based user interface

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the first number.
2. The user then enters another number and selects an operation.
3. The result of the operation becomes the new "current result".
4. This process repeats until the user chooses to exit.

## 💡 Example
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the next number: 5
Choose an operation:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Updated Result: 15.00

Enter the next number: 3
Choose an operation: 3
Updated Result: 45.00
